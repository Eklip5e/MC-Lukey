## Hey you! Yes, you.
**Are you looking for a Modpack to play with your friends?**
Oh boy! This is your [Lukey](https://modrinth.com/project/lukey) day.
Enjoy your stay here, playing a nice and aesthetic modpack, but also with some twists for the techiest ones.

---

### Is it just "another vanilla modpack"?
For my experience, this is **the best combination of mods**, to make the personal best experience you can get from a not heavily modded modpack.
### Not only Vanilla.
I've never liked playing plain Vanilla, so let's put some frosting and chocolate to it: 
- Create
- Xaero's Minimap with Additional Features
- Applied Energistics 2
- Sophisticated Backpacks
- QoL Features
- Terralith and Tectonic
- Computer Craft
- Farmer's Delight
And more!
### FPS Friendly!
Lukey isn't a lightweight Modpack, but it is packed with performance mods such as [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) etc., that improve rendering performance, logic performance, memory usage, which helps you squeeze out even the last frame.
### Who needs OptiFine?
Lukey has all the Optifine features you desire, including built-in shaders, connected textures, zoom and all the resource packs that improves and smoothes your vanilla experience.
### Is this hostable?
I've also tought on that:
**I'm planning on deploying a server zip, so you can host it in no time**
### What if there's some problem?
In case you're experiencing bugs, crashes, or other issues, feel free to open an issue on theÂ [issue tracker](https://github.com/Eklip5e/MC-Lukey/issues). 
Just make sure to include necessary information like your hardware/software so that it's easier to resolve those issues.
